## Introduction
Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are an intuitive way to understand the relationships between genes with simialar gene expresssion profiles and infer the function of these related genes. In these networks, nodes represent genes and the connection between these nodes (edges) represent the degree of similarity between the nodes. Genes with similar biological function tend to result in similar expression profiles[@doi:10.1126/science.274.5287.546]. Because of this expectations, functional biologists tend to mine GCNs for "communities" of interacting genes by using theory from network science community.
