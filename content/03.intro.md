## Introduction
Since the early days of microarray experiments, much of biology has focused on inferring gene function on a global scale through the creation of gene coexpression networks. Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are an intuitive way to understand the relationships between genes with simialar gene expresssion profiles. In these networks, nodes represent genes and thhe connection between genes (edges) provide a visual 

These relations are often found through mathematical methods such as Pearson correlation, mutual information
